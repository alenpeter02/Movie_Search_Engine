# Movie Name Search Engine
This is a simple movie name search engine developed using Streamlit, SQLite, and Sentence Transformers. The application allows users to search for movie names based on the similarity of their subtitles to a given query. It utilizes cosine similarity between embeddings generated from the subtitles and the query to retrieve the most relevant movie names.

## Features
### Query-Based Search:
Users can enter a query related to a movie and find similar movie names.
### Embedding Averaging: 
Movie embeddings are generated by averaging the embeddings of all subtitles associated with each movie.
### Top 10 Recommendations: 
The application returns the top 10 unique movie names based on the similarity score with the query.

## Components
### 1. Sentence Transformer Model:
   The application uses a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model to encode both the query and the subtitles into fixed-size numerical vectors, also known as embeddings. These embeddings capture semantic similarities between pieces of text.
### 2. ChromaDB: 
The SQLite database, ChromaDB, stores movie subtitles and their associated embeddings. Each movie's embeddings are averaged from the embeddings of its subtitles. This ensures consistent shapes for each movie's embeddings.
### 3. Streamlit User Interface: 
Streamlit is used to create an interactive web interface for the application. Users can input their query, and the application returns the top 10 unique movie names based on the cosine similarity between the query and the embeddings of movie subtitles stored in ChromaDB.
