that i should be mad at myself because i chose to be stupid i m sorry that i left you hanging you know i completely understand that you had to board a ship for work but to leave without saying a word you didn t talk to me or come and see me one last time i found that hard to accept and i waited for you i even told myself you ll explain everything to me because you love me but come to think of it i realized you never once told me you loved me so it wa stupid of me to assume that you loved me oh well i guess when someone court you it doesn t mean he love you i did love you oh well the past is the past let s leave it behind u it s been seven long year anyway it s better this way because if we ended up together i might have been a hindrance to you hmm you might not be a successful a you are now

assigned to the kitchen that s where i learned to cook hmm so that s how miss monica fell for you by putting a spell on her food during her cruise of course not that s not even where we met we met in orvieto italy what in italy yeah i only spent one year on the ship then i hopped off i ended up working a a caregiver then i met my employer he look like your grandfather that s why i felt at ease taking care of him did you have a hard time taking care of him not really but it s the loneliness that will get you there aren t many filipino there plus se or luigi s vineyard wa in a provincial area oh last year his closest friend visited him monica wa with them but after a few day se or luigi passed away monica wa the one who helped me she really surprised me she didn t mind doing the work

t be a waste of money i just can t see myself running a high end bar is this because i missed dinner last night so you re backing out is that it monica i m not interested in setting up a bar then study up on it why do you keep insisting on this furniture thing monica you re my girlfriend but you don t seem to have faith in me unlike steph who ha complete faith in me ant sorry i have faith in you okay i m gonna reconsider that furniture thing but i can t go to the province with you maybe next time okay move my meeting with mr reyes to p m and tell him i m on my way okay yes ma am miss monica yes can i ask you something okay make it fast because i m busy what i saw your car outside the restaurant last night why didn t you come in follow me actually i kind of feel guilty about it i just wish life wa le complicated when i met him in italy i wa still heartbroken over andrew so when anton told me he wanted to come with me on the cruise i wa okay with it normally i wouldn t have allowed it because i barely knew him but you know he made me laugh he made me feel beautiful and special have you ever felt that way steph his rural attitude his corny humor even his bad grammar all of that wa so wonderful that wa back then when we were still in paradise but not now when we re back in the real world it s just better to introduce him to family and friend a a fellow passenger that i met on a cruise ship there s no way that i would tell them i m in a relationship with a seaman turned caregiver it s embarrassing he had an honorable job steph don t be so naive after all we re in the world of pr and that s not the point this is the first guy who is willing to do anything for me who is willing to change for me that s why i really want this relationship to work but you confronting me like this and planting seed of hope in his furniture shop miss monica if you could just give anton a chance i did i told him i would reconsider but only after i ve been proven wrong that it s not going to be a waste of money catch my drift steph i think this is going beyond what miss monica is asking of you this is girlfriend level effort for a guy you claim to be just a friend steph i m just concerned for you this might be another m u for you a mi understanding with major uncertainty come on let s grab some lunch okay i might lose some weight oh gosh i m super excited i m ready for the beach see look at me i put on sunscreen oh show a little excitement i can t believe you finally you get to introduce me to your family mm mm tep you re in uniform what are you doing here do we have a session no but i heard mtv can t go with you to the province to see your furniture yeah i m kind of bummed out about it mmm no no no you re not allowed to mope i m here because i m going

ha worked in so many place when i met him he wa working for a big wine ranch in italy and i thought he wa done with it but you know once a businessman always a businessman actually i m not sure if i m a good businessman at all but you re right but why i m used to taking risk that s what i did when i jumped off a ship to become an illegal immigrant oh he wa a seaman before that s interesting it wa hard but a lot of people helped me that s why i have so much respect for wealthy people like you so when i got rich i told myself that i should never feel ashamed about where my money came from
